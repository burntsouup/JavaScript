## 📖 Completed Lessons

### 00 - Introduction to JavaScript ✅
**File**: `Phase-1-Fundamentals/00-Introduction-to-JavaScript.md`

**Topics Covered:**
- What is JavaScript? (multi-paradigm, dynamic, JIT-compiled, single-threaded)
- History of JavaScript (1995 → 2025, ECMAScript evolution)
- How browsers execute JavaScript (Critical Rendering Path)
- Browser components (Rendering Engine, JS Engine, etc.)
- JavaScript Engine high-level (Parser → Bytecode → JIT → Execution)
- JavaScript Engine detailed (Execution Context, Call Stack, Memory Management)
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Event Loop, Web APIs, Task Queue)
- Modern JavaScript in 2025

**Key Takeaways:**
- JavaScript created in 10 days (1995), now powers ~98% of websites
- ES6 (2015) was a major turning point
- Understanding execution context and call stack is crucial
- Event Loop enables async behavior in single-threaded language

### 01 - Variables and Data Types ✅
**File**: `Phase-1-Fundamentals/01-Variables-and-Data-Types.md`

**Topics Covered:**
- Modern variable declarations (`const`, `let`, avoiding `var`)
- All 8 JavaScript data types (7 primitives + Object)
- Primitives: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
- Objects and reference types
- Type checking (`typeof`, `Array.isArray()`, etc.)
- Type coercion (implicit vs explicit)
- Memory management (Stack vs Heap, Primitives vs References)
- Best practices for 2025

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed, never `var`
- Primitives are immutable and stored by value
- Objects are mutable and stored by reference
- Use strict equality (`===`) to avoid type coercion issues
- Understanding memory is crucial for performance
